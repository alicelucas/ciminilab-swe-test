First of all, thank you for your time, it is truly appreciated!

This repository contains two tasks - one of which should be completed in typescript and one of which can be completed in any scientific language you like (thought it was originally designed for Python and the example links are for that language). 

The purpose of these excercises is simply to get an insight into your coding style in each library and your comfort completing tasks in each.

NOTE: Do not make your solutions to either of the two tasks publicly accessbile!

When ready, return the solutions for Task 1 and Task 2 to [ngogober@broadinstitute.org](ngogober@broadinstitute.org) 
and [bcimini@broadinstitute.org](bcimini@broadinstitute.org) using the following formats:
- For Task 1 (The React-Typescript project), please return a zip file that contains the modified project,
 which includes all source code, including the `package.json` file to install all dependencies. We want to be able to 
 run the app locally on our machines and try out the app. You may also provide a GitHub link, but make sure it is a private repo, and that you give us access. Add [gnodar01](https://github.com/gnodar01/) and [bethac07](https://github.com/bethac07).
- For Task 2, return the script written to complete the task. Alternatively, you may 
provide a Jupyter Notebook or any other format that you find works best for you. Please specify the language+version and 
library versions needed to execute your script. Again, feel free to provide a GitHub link, giving us access to the repo.


Feel free to contact [ngogober@broadinstitute.org](ngogober@broadinstitute.org) for any questions you may have. 

Thank you again for your time!
