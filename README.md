First of all, thank you for your time, it is truly appreciated!

This repository contains two tasks - one of which should be completed in typescript and one of which should be completed in Python. 

The purpose of these excercises is simply to get an insight into your coding style in each library and your comfort completing tasks in each.

When ready, return the solutions for Task 1 and Task 2 to [alucas@broadinstitute.org](alucas@broadinstitute.org) 
and [bcimini@broadinstitute.org](bcimini@broadinstitute.org) using the following formats:
- For Task 1 (The React-Typescript project), please return a zip file that contains the modified project,
 which includes all source code, including the `package.json` file to install all dependencies. We want to be able to 
 run the app locally on our machines and try out the app.
- For Task 2 (the Python project), return the python `.py` script written to complete the task. Alternatively, you may 
provide a Jupyter Notebook or any other format that you find works best for you. Please specify the Python version and 
library versions needed to execute your script.


Feel free to contact [alucas@broadinstitute.org](alucas@broadinstitute.org) for any questions you may have. 

Thank you again for your time!
